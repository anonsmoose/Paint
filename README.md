# Paint

# Introduction

The main project in our software design course (CSC207) was to create a program similar to Microsoft's Paint application, and then add our own features to differentiate it. This involved the use of software design patterns in order to make the program readable, modular and easy to add to. We used the AWT graphics package in Java  and used Github and scrum to collaborate with teammates.
